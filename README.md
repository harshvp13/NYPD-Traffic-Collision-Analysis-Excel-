NYPD Traffic Collisions-Excel Project

📈 Chart 1: Collisions in NYC by Year (Monthly Trends)

🔧 Tasks:

Counted Collision ID by Year and Month

Filtered incomplete April 2023 data

Displayed multi-line chart (2021–2023)

Applied chart formatting

📊 Inference:

Collision counts peaked around May–June for all years.

2021 recorded the highest number of monthly collisions, especially in May–June (>10,000).

2022 showed a slightly lower but stable pattern, especially in summer and fall.

2023 had the lowest collision counts in early months but showed similar growth through spring.

Insight: There are consistent seasonal increases in spring to summer. Late fall/winter months see lower activity, possibly due to weather, school breaks, or travel patterns.


📈  Chart 2: Heatmap of Collisions by Weekday & Hour

🔧 Tasks:
Extracted Weekday and Hour from timestamps

Counted Collision ID per weekday-hour pair

Built a heatmap to detect collision timing patterns

Applied red-based 3-color scale

📊 Inference:

Collisions peak during commute hours (8 AM–9 AM and 3 PM–6 PM)

Weekdays (Mon–Fri) see high collision counts, especially Tuesday–Thursday

Highest risk times: 8 AM and 4–6 PM (school/work transitions)

Weekends (Sat–Sun) show reduced intensity, especially early morning hours

Insight: NYPD and DOT should focus enforcement and safety interventions during weekday rush hours.


 📈 Chart 3: Contributing Factors to Collisions

🔧 Tasks:
Counted collisions by Contributing Factor

Sorted top 10 by volume

Calculated % of Dangerous Collisions (Injury/Fatality)

Applied data bars to % values

📊 Inference:

Top Cause: "Driver Inattention/Distraction" (58,308 collisions, 39% dangerous)

Most Dangerous: "Failure to Yield Right-of-Way" (64% dangerous rate)

Other high-risk factors:

Traffic Control Disregarded (59%)

Unsafe Speed (46%)

Following Too Closely (40%)

Factors like “Backing Unsafely” and “Passing Too Closely” had low severity.

Insight: Educational campaigns and penalties should target yield violations, speeding, and traffic signal disregard.
